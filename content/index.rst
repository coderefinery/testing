Software testing
================

In this lesson we will discuss why testing often needs to be part of the
software development cycle and how such a cycle can be implemented. We will
see automated testing works and practice designing and writing tests.

.. prereq::

   1. You need `pytest <http://doc.pytest.org>`__ (as part of Anaconda or Miniconda or Virtual Environment).

   2. (Optional) To work on exercises in other languages than Python,
      please follow the instructions under "Language-specific
      instructions" in the `Test design episode <https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/test-design/>`__
      to install the recommended testing frameworks.
