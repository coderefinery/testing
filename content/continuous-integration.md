# Automated testing

```{questions}
- How can we implement automatic testing each time we push changes to the repository?
- Why is it good to autoclose issues with commit messages?
```

## Continuous integration

We will now learn to set up automatic tests using either GitHub Actions or
GitLab CI - you can choose which one to use and instructions are provided for both.

This exercise can be run in "collaborative mode" by following instead the instructions
in [Full-cycle collaborative workflow](./full-cycle-ci). In the collaborative version steps
C-D below are performed by a collaborator.


```{challenge} Exercise CI-1: Create and use a continuous integration workflow on GitHub or GitLab

In this exercise, we will:

- **A.** Create and add code to a repository on GitHub/GitLab (or, alternatively, fork and clone an existing example repository)
- **B.** Set up tests with GitHub Actions/ GitLab CI
- **C.** Find a bug in our repository and open an issue to report it
- **D.** Fix the bug on a bugfix branch and open a pull request (GitHub)/ merge request (GitLab)
- **E.** Merge the pull/merge request and see how the issue is automatically closed.
- **F.** Create a test to increase the code coverage of our tests.
```

### Prerequisites

If you are new to Git, you can find a step-by-step guide to
setting up repositories and making commits in
[this git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/).
If you are new to pull requests / merge requests, you can learn all about them
in the [Collaborative Git lesson](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/).


### Step 1: Create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab OR fork from the example repo

#### Create a new repository

- Begin by creating a repository called (for example) *example-ci*.
- **Before** you create the repository, select **"Initialize this repository
  with a README"** (otherwise you try to clone an empty repo).
- Clone the repository (`git clone git@github.com:<yourGitID>/example-ci.git`).
- Add the following files and code

`````{tabs}
   ````{group-tab} Python
      Add a file `functions.py` containing:

      ```python
      def add(a, b):
          return a + b

      def subtract(a, b):
          return a + b  # <--- fix this in step 7

      def multiply(a, b):
          return a * b

      def convert_fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
          return multiply(subtract(fahrenheit, 32), 9 / 5) # <-- Fix this in step 7
      ```
      and a file `test_functions.py` containing:

      ```python

      from functions import add, subtract, multiply
      from functions import convert_fahrenheit_to_celsius as f2c
      import pytest

      def test_add():
          assert add(2, 3) == 5
          assert add('space', 'ship') == 'spaceship'

      # uncomment the following test in step 5
      #def test_subtract():
      #    assert subtract(2, 3) == -1

      # uncomment the following test in step 11
      # def test_convert_fahrenheit_to_celsius():
      #    assert f2c(32) == 0
      #    assert f2c(122) == pytest.approx(50)
      #    with pytest.raises(AssertionError):
      #        f2c(-600)

      ```
      Finally, stage the files (`git add <filename>`), commit (`git commit -m "some commit message"`),
      and push the changes (`git push origin main`).

   ````
   ````{group-tab} R
      - Make a folder ``rtestingexample``
      - In that folder create a file ``DESCRIPTION`` with the following contents:
        ```
        Package: rtestingexample
        Title: Testing package for R and github actions
        Version: 0.0.0.9000
        Authors@R:
            person("Your", "Name", , "none@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"),
                  )
        Author: Your Name
        Maintainer: Your Name <none@example.com>
        Description: Just a few functions that are being tested.
        License: MIT
        Encoding: UTF-8
        Depends: testthat
        Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
        RoxygenNote: 7.2.3
        ```
      - In that folder create a file ``NAMESPACE`` with the following content:
        ```
        # Default NAMESPACE created by R
        # Remove the previous line if you edit this file

        # Export all names
        exportPattern(".")

        # Import all packages listed as Imports or Depends
        import(
        testthat
        )
        ```
      - create a subfolder `R` (this will contain all functions of the package)
      - in the `R` folder create a file `functions.R`with the following content:
        ```R
        add <- function(a,b){
            return(a + b);
        }

        subtract <- function(a,b){
            return(a - b);
        }

        multiply <- function(a,b){
            return(a * b);
        }

        convert_fahrenheit_to_celsius <- function(fahrenheit){
            C_temp <- multiply(subtract(fahrenheit,32),5/9);
            return(C_temp);
        }
        ```
      - create a subfolder `tests`
      - in `tests` create a folder `testthat` and a file `testthat.R` with the following content:
        ```R
        # This file is part of the standard setup for testthat.
        # It is recommended that you do not modify it.
        #
        # Where should you do additional test configuration?
        # Learn more about the roles of various files in:
        # * https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html
        # * https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/test_package.html#special-files

        library(testthat)
        library(rtestingexample)

        test_check("rtestingexample")
        ```
      - in the `testthat` folder create a file `test-functions.R` with the following content:
        ```R

        test_that(desc = "Add", code = {
          c <- add(2,3);   # Runs the function

          # Test that the result is the correct value
          expect_equal(c,5);

          # Test that the result is numeric
          expect_true(is.numeric(c));
        })

        # uncomment the following test in step 11
        #test_that(desc = "Fahrenheit to Celsius", code = {
        #
        #  temp_C <- convert_fahrenheit_to_celsius(50);
        #  expect_equal(temp_C,10);
        #  expect_true(is.numeric(temp_C));
        #})

        # uncomment the following test in step 5
        #test_that(desc = "Subtract", code = {
        #  c <- subtract(3,2);
        #  expect_equal(c,1);
        #  expect_true(is.numeric(c));
        #})

   ````
`````



#### Fork and clone an existing example repository

- Fork the example repo. There are two options one for [python](https://github.com/AaltoRSE/PyTestingExample) and one for [R](https://github.com/AaltoRSE/RTestingExample).
- Clone your fork (`git clone git@github.com:<yourGitID>/<Py/R>TestingExample.git`).



### Step 2: Run tests locally
`````{tabs}
  ````{group-tab} Python
  You can now run your tests locally with
  ```
  pytest
  ```
  ````
  ````{group-tab} R
  You can now run your tests (and a complete check of this package) locally by running:
  ```
  Rscript -e 'testthat::test_local()'`
  ```
> **_NOTE:_** You might need to install the testthat package before you can run the command above ( in R `install.packages("testthat")`)
`````



### Step 3: Enable automated testing

`````{tabs}
  ````{group-tab} GitHub-Python

  In this step we will enable GitHub Actions.
  Select "Actions" from your GitHub repository page. You get to a page
  "Get started with GitHub Actions". Select the button for "Configure"
  under Python Application:

  ```{figure} img/python_application.png
  :alt: Selecting a Python workflow

  Select "Python application" as the starter workflow.
  ```

  GitHub creates the following file for you in the subfolder `.github/workflows`.
  Modify the highlited lines according to the action below. This will add a code coverage
  report to new pull requests. The if clause restricts this to pull requests, as otherwise
  this action would not have a target to write the reports to. On pushes only the unittesting is run.

  ```

  Commit the change by pressing the "Start Commit" button:

  ```{figure} img/gh_action_commit.png
  :alt: Committing the change

  Committing the file via the GitHub web interface: follow the flow, give it some commit name. You can commit directly to master.
  ```
  ````

  ````{group-tab} GitLab-Python

  In this step we will enable GitLab CI.
  Select "CI/CD" from your Gitlab sidebar of the project. You get to a page
  "Editor". (Instead you can also click on "Add CI/CD" on the main page or just add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file the result is identical.

  Copy the following code snippet into the file. Gitlab will save it as `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
  Add `pytest test_functions.py` to the last line (highlighted):

  ```{code-block} yaml

  :width: 400px

  Committing the file via the GitLab web interface: follow the flow, give it some commit name. You can commit directly to master.
  ```
  ````

  ````{group-tab} GitHub-R

  In this step we will enable GitHub Actions.
  Select "Actions" from your GitHub repository page. You get to a page
  "Get started with GitHub Actions". Unfortunately, as of the creation of this lecture, the default "R package action"
  that is suggested by github is quite complex and not really fit for our purpose. Instead we will create our own
  workflow as detailed below.
  So first click on the " set up a workflow yourself" link above the "Search workflows" field.

  GitHub creates a "main.yml" file that we can now modify as needed.

  - First, replace the name by a more descriptive one (e.g. r_testing.yml)

  - Then add the following code to the file:

    ```{code-block} yaml

                path = "rtestingexample",
                install_path = file.path(Sys.getenv("RUNNER_TEMP"), "package")
              )
            shell: Rscript {0}

          - name: Show testthat output
            if: always()
            run: |

              name: coverage-test-failures
              path: ${{ runner.temp }}/package
    ```
    The action is a modified version of the action generated by [covr](https://covr.r-lib.org/) using the `usethis::use_github_action("test-coverage")` command.
    It is built up from several actions provided by the [r-lib project](https://github.com/r-lib/actions), along with the test/coverage commands.



  Commit the change by pressing the "Start Commit" button:

  ```{figure} img/gh_action_commit.png
  :alt: Committing the change

  Committing the file via the GitHub web interface: follow the flow, give it some commit name. You can commit directly to master.
  ```
  ````


`````


### Step 4: Verify that tests have been automatically run

`````{tabs}
   ````{group-tab} GitHub-Python

   Observe in the repository how the test succeeds. While the test is
   executing, the repository has a yellow marker. This is replaced with a green
   check mark, once the test succeeds:

   ```{figure} img/green_check_mark.png
   :alt: Verify that the test passed

   Green check means passed.
   ```

   Also browse the "Actions" tab and look at the steps there and their output.
   ````

   ````{group-tab} GitLab-Python

   Observe in the repository how the test succeeds. While the test is
   executing, the repository has a blue marker. This is replaced with a green
   check mark, once the test succeeds:

   ```{figure} img/gl_green_check_mark.png
   :alt: Verify that the test passed

   Green check means passed.
   ```

   Also browse the "Pipelines" tab and look at the steps there and their output.
   ````
   ````{group-tab} GitHub-R

   Observe in the repository how the test succeeds. While the test is
   executing, the repository has a yellow marker. This is replaced with a green
   check mark, once the test succeeds:

   ```{figure} img/green_check_mark.png
   :alt: Verify that the test passed

   Green check means passed.
   ```

   Also browse the "Actions" tab and look at the steps there and their output.
   ````
`````


### Step 5: Add a test which reveals a problem

After you committed the workflow file, your GitHub/GitLab repository will be ahead of
your local cloned repository.  Update your local cloned repository:

```console
$ git pull origin main
```

Hint: if the above command fails, check whether the branch name on the GitHub/GitLab
repository is called `main` and not perhaps `master`.

Next uncomment the code in `test_functions.py` under "step 5", commit, and push.
Verify that the test suite now fails on the "Actions" tab (GitHub)
or the "CI/CD->Pipelines" tab (GitLab).


### Step 6: Open an issue on GitHub/GitLab

Open a new issue in your repository about the broken test (click the
"Issues" button on GitHub or GitLab and write a title for the issue).
The plan is that we will fix the issue through a pull/merge request.


### Step 7: Fix the broken test

Now fix the code **on a new branch**, you can call it `yourname/bugfix`.
After you have fixed the code on the new branch, commit the following
commit message `"restore function subtract; fixes #1"` (assuming that
you try to fix issue number 1).

```{callout} Shortcut

   Here it's perfectly possible to take a shortcut and commit and push
   directly to the main branch. If you do this, steps 8-9 below are skipped.
   - When would you push directly to the main branch, and when would you send a
   pull/merge request?
```


Then push to your repository.


### Step 8: Open a pull request (GitHub)/ merge request (GitLab)

Go back to the repository on GitHub or GitLab and open a pull/merge
request. **In a collaborative setting, you could request a code
review from collaborators at this stage.** Before accepting the
pull/merge request, observe how GitHub Actions/ Gitlab CI
automatically tested the code.

If you forgot to reference the issue number in the commit message, you
can still add it to the pull/merge request: `my pull/merge request
title, closes #1`.


### Step 9: Accept the pull/merge request

Observe how accepting the pull/merge request automatically closes the issue (provided
the commit message or the pull/merge request contained the correct issue number).

See also:
- GitHub: [closing issues using keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)
- GitLab: [closing issues using keywords](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues)

Discuss whether this is a useful feature. And if it is, why do you think is it useful?

### Step 10: Increase your code coverage

We are currently missing several functions in our tests. Write a test for the `multiply` function in a new branch and create a pull request.
On python you can directly observe the increase in code coverage.
On R you can have a look at the action (`Actions -> last run of your action -> Select a job -> Test coverage`). If you compare this with the
previous run, you should see an increase once the update is in.

### Step 11 (optional): Repeat steps 5-9 for the `convert_fahrenheit_to_celsius` function:

Repetition helps learning, so let's do the testing again for our `convert_fahrenheit_to_celsius` function.
Uncomment the test for the `convert_fahrenheit_to_celsius` function and repeat steps 5 to 9 fixing the bug this test exposes.


### Discussion

Finally, we discuss together about our experiences with this exercise.

## Where to go from here

- This example was using Python but you can achieve the same automation for R or Fortran or C/C++ or other languages
- This workflow is very useful for collaborators who work on the same code and it works both for
  [centralized](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/02-centralized/) and
  [forking](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/03-distributed/) workflows - have a look at this
  [alternative exercise](./full-cycle-ci) to see how that works.
- GitHub Actions has a [Marketpace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) which offer wide range of automatic workflows
- On GitLab use [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/)
- For Windows builds you can also use [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com)


```{keypoints}
- When fixing bugs or other problems reported in issues, use the issue
  autoclosing mechanism when you send the pull/merge request.
```
