## How to test?

Imperfect tests **run frequently** are better than perfect tests which are
never written:
- Test **frequently** (each commit/push)
- Test **automatically** (e.g. using
  [Azure pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) or
  [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) or [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) or similar services)
- Test with [numerical tolerance](http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2013-06-05)
  (see also ["What Every Programmer Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic"](https://floating-point-gui.de/))
- Think about **code coverage** ([Coveralls](https://coveralls.io) or [Codecov](https://codecov.io) or similar services)

## Defensive programming

- Assume that mistakes will happen and introduce guards against them.
- Use **assertions** for things you believe will/should never happen.
- Use **exceptions** for anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring
  special processing.

```python
def kelvin_to_celsius(temp_k):
    """
    Converts temperature in Kelvin
    to Celsius.
    """
    assert temp_k >= 0.0, "ERROR: negative T_K"
    temp_c = temp_k - 273.15
    return temp_c
```

---

## Unit tests

- **Unit tests** are functions
- Test one unit: module or even single function
- Good documentation of the capability and dependencies of a module
- Unit tests are not about testing units of measure and unit conversion, they are about testing small components (units) of a code

---

## Integration tests

- **Integration tests** verify whether multiple modules are working well together
- Like in a car assembly we have to test all components independently and also whether the components are working together when combined
- Unit tests can be used for testing independent components (_e.g._ battery, controller, motor) and integration tests to check if car is working overall

---

## Regression tests

- Similarly to integration tests, **regression tests** often operate on the
  whole code base
- Rather than assuming that the test author knows what the correct
  result should be, regression tests look to the past for the expected behavior
- Often spans multiple code versions: when developing a new version, input
  and output files of a previous version are used to test that the same
  behaviour is observed

---

## Test-driven development

- In **test-driven development**, one writes tests before writing code
- Very often we know the result that a function is supposed to produce
- Development cycle (red, green, refactor):
    - Write the test
    - Write an empty function template
    - **Verify that the test fails**
    - Program until the test passes
    - Perhaps improve until you are happy (refactor)
    - Move on

---

## Continuous integration

- **Continuous integration** is basically when you automatically test
  every single commit/push (you test whether code integrates **before** you integrate it)

---

## Code coverage

- If I break the code and all tests pass who is to blame?
- **Code coverage** measures and documents which lines of code have been traversed during a test run
- It is possible to have line-by-line coverage
- [Real-life example](https://coveralls.io/github/bast/runtest)

---

## Total time to test matters

- Total time to test matters
- If the test set takes 7 hours to run, it is likely that nobody will run it
- Identify fast essential test set that has sufficient coverage and is sufficiently
  short to be run before each commit or push
- Test code can be marked (grouped). Here our `pytest` is marked:

```python
@pytest.mark.conversion
def test_fahrenheit_to_celsius():
    temp_c = fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp_f=100.0)
    expected_result = 37.777777
    assert abs(temp_c - expected_result) < 1.0e-6
```

```sh
$ pytest -v -m conversion
```

---

## Tests don't guarantee correctness

Not only do tests not guarantee the absence of bugs, they can
also contain their own bugs. 
Here's an example of how we could get the testing of the
`kelvin_to_celsius` function wrong:

```python
def kelvin_to_celsius(temp_k):
    """
    Converts temperature in Kelvin
    to Celsius.
    """
    assert temp_k >= 0.0, "ERROR: negative T_K"
    temp_c = temp_k + 273.15  # BUG!
    return temp_c

# buggy test
def test_kelvin_to_celsius():
    temp_c = kelvin_to_celsius(temp_k=0.0)
    expected_result = 273.15
    assert abs(temp_c - expected_result) < 1.0e-6    
```

All tests are happy!

## Testing frameworks

A large number of testing frameworks, tools and libraries are available for
different programming languages. Some of the most popular ones are listed
in the [Quick Reference](./quick-reference).

---

## Good practices

- Test before committing (use the Git staging area)
- Fix broken tests immediately (dirty dishes effect)
- Do not deactivate tests "temporarily"
- Think about coverage (physics and lines of code)
- Go public with your testing dashboard and issues/tickets
- Test controlled errors: if something is expected to fail, test for that
- Create benchmark calculations to cover various performance-critical modules and monitor timing
- Make testing easy to run (`make test`)
- Make testing easy to analyze
    - Do not flood screen with pages of output in case everything runs OK
    - Test with numerical tolerance (extremely annoying to compare digits by eye)


```{keypoints}
- Assertions, exceptions, unit tests, integration tests and regression
  tests are used to test a code on different levels
- Test driven development is one way to develop code which is tested
  from the start
- Continuous integration is when every commit/merge is tested
  automatically
```
