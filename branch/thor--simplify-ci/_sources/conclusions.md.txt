# Conclusions and recommendations

- Explore and use the good tools that exist out there
- An incomplete list of testing frameworks can be found in the [Quick Reference](quick-reference)
- Automate tests: faster feedback and reduce the number of surprises
- Strike a healthy balance between unit tests and integration tests
- When adding new functionality, also add tests
- When you discover and fix a bug, also commit a test against this bug
- Use code coverage analysis to identify untested or unused code
- If you make your code easier to test, it becomes more modular
