The lesson Jekyll file structure and browsing layout is inspired by and derived from

We have kept the YAML structure in the episode Markdown files for future compatibility
but have heavily cut down and modified the layout and include files.


## How to include jekyll-common

```


## Tips

- Get inspired by Software Carpentry, e.g.: https://biologyguy.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/
- Students interacting is better than students only listening
- Share your sources and exercises early to get early feedback
- Do not be afraid to share unfinished and badly structured work
- Make it available and restructure later, do not gold-plate too early
- Use ideally Markdown or RST or Jupyter notebooks (easy to generate nice pages from these formats)
- Divide your session into modules and files
- Try to make it interactive: mix type-along sessions with short exercises
- Motivate each session
- Set and document goals for each module
- Mind the cognitive load (better few messages that are clear rather than too much information)
- Involve others to get your material tested
- Create a new repository for each session, makes it easier to move things around
